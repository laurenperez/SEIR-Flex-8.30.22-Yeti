# Components and JSX

## Learning Objectives

*   Identify and define React Components
*   Describe why we use Components in React
*   Build a React Component
*   Review the rules and best practices of working with Components
*   Work with JSX (JavaScript and XML) in Components

## Components

The basic unit you'll be working with in React is a **Component**.  Components are pieces of our application that we define once and can reuse throughout.  They also can be extended to include additional functionality, including the following:

- all or part of the applications` state` (data)
- accept data from a parent component as `props`
- leverage a Components `lifecycle` methods

`state`, `props` and `lifecycle methods` are fundamental concepts in React and we will work with them quite extensively while learning React. 

#### Components Are Used Every

If you are familiar with Bootstrap then you already understand the concept of a `Component`.  Bootstrap even has a section in their documentation dedicated to just components.

Let's take a look at [Bootstraps section on Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/). 

On the left hand side you will see a link to `Components` and clicking on that will open the door to over 2 dozen Components.

Let's take this `Bootstrap Card` component for instance.  It's a common design that we have all seen on the web and perhaps have even used yourself in previous projects. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oKyuaBn.png" width=200/>

It's essentially comprised of the following html.  As a developer all you would need to do is copy/paste the html and update the relevant content placeholders.  

It's essentially a grouping of elements that, as a Component, is reusable. 

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Bootstrap essentially allows us to pick and choose from this reusable pool of Components and to implement any web page layout/design.

### React Components

Although Boostrap comes with predefined Components out of the box, React does no such thing.

React allows you to decide what constitutes a Component and then provides the framework for you to add the required HTML and JS to create them. 

So instead of creating a few large files, you will organize your web app into small, reusable Components that encompass their own content and business logic.

#### Train Station Schedule Example
Take for instance an example of a train station schedule. There are elements that repeat themselves in the html structure and essentially perform the same function. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D6HngOk.png" />

These Components, much like the HTML used to render them, will be structured into various nested Components.
	
```
- TubeTracker
  - Network
      - Line
  - Predictions
      - DepartureBoard
          - Trains
```

- `TubeTracker` contains the application and will render 2 main elements: `Network` and `Predictions`
- `Network` displays each line on the network and renders a `Line` for each line that it contained in it's dataset
- `Line` displays a single station on a line
- `Predictions` controls the state of the departure board and renders `DepartureBoard`
- `DepartureBoard` displays the current station and platforms and renders a `Train` for each one in its dataset
- `Trains` displays the trains due to arrive at a platform

When using React, building Components will be a thing you will do quite often.


### Rules To Follow

From this point on we will be creating Components, more  than you ever imagined, so before we begin let's take a moment to discuss the `requirements` and `best practices` for creating Components.  

Some of the requirements are specific to `JSX`, short for `JavaScript And XML`. 

:oncoming_police_car: - Rules (Component Specific)
- They must import `React`
- They must be called within the JSX using an uppercase first letter
- They must return some form of UI (user interface) 
- They must be exported from the file to be imported into another Component 

:oncoming_police_car: - Rules (JSX Specific)
- They can return only one top level element but that element can contain numerous children. 
- Any JS within JSX must be enclosed in curly braces `{}`
- The keyword `class` is reserved so classes must be renamed `className`

:star: Best Practices
- Each Component should be in it's own file
- Each Component file should be in a separate folder 
- Each Component should reference it's own CSS

### Class vs Hook Components

As of `React 16.8` Components now come in 3 forms, all of which follow the same requirements and best practices. 

- Class Based (with or without state)
- Functional Using Hooks - leverages one or more `Hooks` and/or includes `state`
- Presentational - Renders UI only and is `stateless`

#### Functional Components

Being that you are familiar with JS functions writing a Functional Component is much easier to understand. 


```js
const App = () => (
    <div>Functional Component</div>
)
```

As we can see a `Functional` Component is more streamlined and concise. It's written using the `fat-arrow` syntax which allows it to take advantage of the `implicit` return.  

If we only need to return `JSX` then this way of writing the Component will suffice.  However if we needed to include additional functionality then we would need to write the Component as follows:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>Functional Component</div>
  )
}
```

As we can see this requires curly braces `{}` and an `explicit` return statement. 


## JSX

One thing to note about Bootstrap is that there is a distinct separation between HTML, CSS and JS.  It takes the `separation of concerns` modality and requires the import of a separate css and js file.  So in order to fully work with Bootstrap not only do you need to include the Bootstrap specific HTML but also import the following files:
```html
<!-- BOOTSTRAP CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z" crossorigin="anonymous">
<!-- BOOTSTRAP JS AND REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES-->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-9/reFTGAW83EW2RDu2S0VKaIzap3H66lZH81PoYlFhbGU+6BZp6G7niu735Sk7lN" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-B4gt1jrGC7Jh4AgTPSdUtOBvfO8shuf57BaghqFfPlYxofvL8/KUEfYiJOMMV+rV" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

React however brings the HTML and JS together into one file using `JSX`.  It can also include the CSS to make the Component self containing. 

JSX is a language that compiles to JavaScipt and allows us to write code that strongly resembles HTML. 

JSX is not limited to `React` and can be implemented in other frameworks. 

#### Rules For Writing JSX

Let's review the rules once again for working with JSX.

- They can render only one top level element but that element can contain numerous children. 
- As per CSS, the word `class` is replaced with `className`
- Any JavaScript code must be surrounding in opening/closing curly braces
- Any Component created via a loop must include a `key` prop


Keeping all these rules in mind let's see what happens if you try to render two top level elements.  

##### Single Top Level Parent
Let's add another `div`

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>Top</div>
    <div>Functional Component</div>
  )
}
```

We should get the following error regarding `Adjacent JSX elements...`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hheNsc3.png" width=400/>

<br>

We can fix that by wrapping all the HTML in a top level element, such as another `div` or by using a `React` fragment.

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div>Top</div>
      <div>Functional Component</div>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```

Which can also be written as:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Top</div>
      <div>Functional Component</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Replacing `class` with `className`

Although this won't cause the same fatal error as adding two top level parents elements, it will produce a warning. 

Let's see that that warning in action by adding a `class`.

```js
const App = () => (
  <>
    <div class='top'>Top</div>
    <div>Functional Component</div>
  </>
)
```

In Chrome DevTools we should see the following warning in the `Console`
