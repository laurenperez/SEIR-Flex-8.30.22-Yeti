# Project 4: Build a full-stack Application with Django & React

<br>

## Overview

__**You have the choice to complete this project as an individual or in a group.**__

You (and your teammates) will architect, design, and build a full-stack web app using the **Python-based Django Web Framework**.

<br>


## Planning Requirements 


All of the following should be included in your project `README.md`

<br>

### Trello Board

   A **[Trello](https://trello.com/) board** with the following:
    
  ☐ **User Stories**
  ☐ **Backlog**
  ☐ **In Progress**
  ☐ **Completed**

    
  **User Stories** should follow this structure:
  
**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**

<br>

### Readme

☐ Your repo must include a **`README.md`** with:

- An introduction of your app along with **a screenshot** 
    - one is all you need to "introduce" your application
- Explanations of the **technologies** used 
  - including outside APIs if used
- A link to your **Trello** board that contains your **user stories**
- **ERD**
- **Wireframes**
- A link to your **deployed app on Netlify**
- Description of any **future enhancements** planned.
    
<br>

### Wireframes

  ☐ Please include wireframes of the main pages of functionality, e.g. Landing Page, Index Page, Show Page, etc.
    
<br>
    
### SQL ERD
    
  ☐ An **ERD** showing the attributes of each Model entity and the relationships between them. 
    
    
  Refer to the Django Relationships lecture for assistance.


<br>

## Technical Requirements


**Your APP must:** 

  ☐ Be a full-stack application using **Django** and **React**.

  ☐ Persist data using **PostreSQL**.

  ☐ Have at least one **model**.

  ☐ Have full **CRUD** route capabilities for that model.

  ☐ Be **deployed online** using **Netlify** for the frontend application.

<br>

## Optional Features

  ☐ A **deployed backend** using Heroku, AWS, Redis or another service.

  ☐ Consume data from a **third-party API**.

  ☐ **Authenticate** users using Django's built-in authentication.

  ☐ Implement **authorization** by restricting access to the creation, updating & deletion of resources per User

<br>

### Presentations

<!-- **Your entire team must participate in the presentation of the project.** -->

You will have approximately 5-10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**

	☐ Intro your project by paraphrasing the README.
	
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

	☐ Launch the project by clicking the link in the README.
	
	
	☐ Be sure to demo all CRUD data operations.
	
3. **Show/discuss your code:**

	☐ Show the "main" Django model.
	
	☐ Show the code for the main model's view.

4. **Share the experience:**

	☐ What was your biggest challenge?
	
	☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
	
5. **Q & A + Feedback**

<br>

### Workflow for Individuals:

☐ Your project must show **frequent commits** dating back to the start of the project.

<br>

### Workflow for Teams:

☐ Your team must **manage team contributions and collaboration** using Git, GitHub and a standard team work-flow.  Here are some references:

- [Team Workflow Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg)
- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [Cheatsheet in Class Repo](../../resources/git_workflow_team_cheatsheet.md)

☐ All team members need to **contribute equitably** to the project **via git commits**.

<br>

### Suggestions for Success ( If working as a Team! )

1.  Identify roles on the team.

Some examples of helpful roles:

  - **Scrum Master**: the leader of the Agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, etc.) and manager of Trello.
  - **GitHub Manager**: the primary person for managing the repo and GitHub  team workflow (merging pull requests, etc.).
  - **Documenter**: the person in charge of the README, etc.
  - **API Manager**: the person in charge of researching, registering with, etc. APIs.
  - **Designer**: the person in charge of UI design/layout and styling.
  - **Database manager**: this person will be in charge of creating and
    managing the models and their relationships.

  
  You *don't have to formally fulfill any of the above roles!* They are only listed to provide guidance.

<br>

2. If using Authentication, your app's functionality revolves around the logged in user, implement authentication and basic navigation first!

3. Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP – feature creep can doom a project!

4.  Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.

5. Be consistent with your code style. If you are working in a team make sure it looks like a unified effort.

6. Do your best to have only one dev working on a certain file between commits.  This will avoid merge conflicts. This is another reason to separate responsibilities between team members.

7. Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something
    because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

8. Pair programming can be a great way for team members to share knowledge and contribute to the project.

9. Consider following a [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) approach where the team is always developing together on a single computer.  Read [this post](http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/06/01/mob-programming/) for more information.

### Assistance from Instructional Team

- All requests for assistance should be **slacked to the class help channel, or squad channel, not individual instructors**.  This approach will provide the best and quickest response for you or your team, as well as be helpful to other students that may be faced with the same issue.

<br>


## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If your instructor(s) determine that your project does not meet the above requirements (denoted using checkboxes), you will be given **3 calendar days** to address the deficiencies identified.  
 - As outlined in the student handbook **there is only a single opportunity to resubmit a project during the course**. For example, if you already resubmitted Project 2, you will not be permitted to resubmit this project.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback, please ask!
