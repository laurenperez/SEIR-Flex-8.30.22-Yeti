## Deliverable Submission Procedures

<br>
<br>

- Depending on the assignment, your homework may be completed on [repl.it](https://repl.it/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- All homework deliverables are submitted throught the link at the top of our course site.
- Homework is due **one week** from the day it was assigned
- If homework is marked `incomplete`, you may be asked to revise your code and re-submit it

 **We will walk through this together the first time!**

<br>
<br>

### Homework

- To be marked complete, each HW deliverable must have **100% of the minimum tasks** specified per that assignment
- Students must complete at least **80%** of all homework assignments to graduate

<br>
<br>

### Projects

- Students must complete all of the **minimum technical requirements** for each unit project
- Parameters for minimum requirements will be explained when the project is assigned

<br>
<br>

## Graduation Requirements:

- Atleast 80% completion of all homework deliverables by the end of each unit
- No more than 24 missed hours of class and outcomes during the cohort
- All unit projects must recieve a passing score ( 1 late submit or resubmission allowed )

<br>
<br>

### Attendance Policy

- Have at least an **80% attendance** record ( you’ve missed **24 hours** total or less of class )
- Attendance is taken at the start of every class meeting
- 3 late arrivals and/or early departures will constitute one absence **( 4 hours )**
- Unexcused absences are not permitted unless it’s an exceptional circumstance
- Students who have been excessively absent may be withdrawn

You may have up to a three-day grace period period on a project for extenuating circumstances if you get approval before the due date.

Unexcused absences are not allowed. If you will have to miss a class, notify the IA/LI via Slack ahead of time so that we can mark your absence as excused. You may have a 48-hour grace period for notifying the IA/LI in case of emergency. Acceptable excuses include illness, death or critical illness to a family member of significant other, critical life emergency, and religious observances.

Students who have fulfilled all of the above requirements will receive a digital certificate of completion via email 1 week after to the course’s end.

Please contact your instructional team, or a member from student experience if you have questions regarding this policy.

<br>
<br>

#### Zero Account Balance

- Students must have no outstanding balances due on their account

<br>
<br>

### Classroom Culture

Let's all agree to:

- Treat each other with respect
- Avoid bringing distractions into class
- Participate in class
- Be on video with mute on during class

<br>
<br>

### How To Succeed in a Remote Environment

- Communication is key! Please respond in atleast 24 hours to any slack message or email. 
- No distractions during class. This means no cell phones (talking/texting), television, or children around.
- Make sure to speak up and speak out about any problems you are having! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class! Someone else is probably having this same issue!
- Expect the next 6 months to be out of the norm for you. If you have to carve out a personal hour during a family vacation, you will have to do this!
- Make use of office hours! Find a time that works for you and don't cancel on your instructors :)
- Hold yourself accountable. Don't let yourself fall behind!
